Off-plan properties offer attractive payment plans, lower entry prices, and the potential for capital appreciation before completion. However, they come with risks related to construction delays and market uncertainties.

Secondary market properties provide immediate possession and established communities, but typically require larger upfront payments and may have less appreciation potential.
